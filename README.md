Chariot is a team project application developed to facilitate ride sharing for people in a fast and easy way. 
Using a 'mobile first' approach the app is very light and easy to use on a phone or other mobile device.  It
will locate riders or drivers in your area who are going in the same general area and "match" so that contact
can be made directly between riders and drivers.
